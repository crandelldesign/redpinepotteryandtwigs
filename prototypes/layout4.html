        <p>Red Pine Pottery &amp; Twigs is a studio in rural Michigan that has been creating functional stoneware pottery and rustic twig furniture for over 20 years.</p>

        <p>Nestled in a forest of red pines on fourteen acres of trails, ponds and streams, the studio is situated in an idyllic setting that inspires and nourishes creativity. The twig furniture and clay pottery pieces available for purchase thus change periodically. We have two studio sales each year, but welcome inquiries and orders throughout the year.</p>

        <p>The images you will be viewing in the twig and clay galleries show retrospective examples of our work. They are presented here to reflect the spirit of exploration which inspires the current work and are not, unfortunately, intended to be samples for reproduction.</p>

        <p>Contact us to find out whether these pieces are available and/or for information on the most up to date work.</p>
